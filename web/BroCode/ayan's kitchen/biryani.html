        <h3>instructions:</h3>
            <ol id="Procedure">
                <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the soaked, drained rice. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <br>             
                <li>In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick. Sauté until the spices release their aroma.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add chicken pieces and cook until they are no longer pink. Stir in yogurt and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the gravy thickens.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>In a large ovenproof dish, layer half of the partially cooked rice, followed by the chicken masala, and then the remaining rice.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Garnish with fresh coriander and mint leaves before serving. Serve hot with raita or a side salad.</li>
            </ol>
